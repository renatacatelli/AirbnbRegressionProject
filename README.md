# AirbnbRegressionProject

This is a multiple linear regression project of Airbnb data. The objective of the project is to predict the price of Airbnb listings in New York City. The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data), and contains information about Airbnb listings in New York City as of 2019.

In this project, I performed a multiple linear regression analysis to predict the price of the Airbnb listings. I also performed different feature engineering techniques, such as one-hot encoding and target-encoding. 

The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.99681 on the test dataset, indicating that the model explains 99.6% of the variance in the accomodations' prices, being a good fit for the data and predicting precisely new data accomodations' prices. Our mean squared error is 117.03, which means that the model deviates in average $117.03 of the correct prediction.
